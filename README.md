# Insignia 2026

**The intersection of athletic spirit and digital mastery.**

Insignia is the flagship tech fest of the year — not just another conference, but a **competitive arena** where 70% sports aesthetics meet 30% tech innovation. We've stripped away the usual conference vibe and replaced it with the energy of a stadium finale.
